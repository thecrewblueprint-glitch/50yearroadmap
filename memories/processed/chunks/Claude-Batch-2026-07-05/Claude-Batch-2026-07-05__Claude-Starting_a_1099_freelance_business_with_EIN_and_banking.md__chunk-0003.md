xt**. `<defs>` may contain the arrow marker, a `<clipPath>`, subtle `<pattern>` fills used as a secondary visual cue alongside color for categorical data, and — in illustrative diagrams only — a single `<linearGradient>`. Nothing else: no filters, no extra markers.

## Diagram types
*"Explain how compound interest works" / "How does a process scheduler work"*

**Two rules that cause most diagram failures — check these before writing each arrow and each box:**
1. **Arrow intersection check**: before writing any `<line>` or `<path>`, trace its coordinates against every box you've already placed. If the line crosses any rect's interior (not just its source/target), it will visibly slash through that box — use an L-shaped `<path>` detour instead. This applies to arrows crossing labels too.
2. **Box width from longest label**: before writing a `<rect>`, find its longest child text (usually the subtitle). `rect_width = max(title_chars × 8, subtitle_chars × 7) + 24`. A 100px-wide box holds at most a 10-char subtitle. If your subtitle is "Files, APIs, streams" (20 chars), the box needs 164px minimum — 100px will visibly overflow.

**Tier packing:** Compute total width BEFORE placing. Example — 4 pub/sub consumer boxes:
- WRONG: x=40,160,260,360 w=160 → 40-60px overlaps (4×160=640 > 480 available)
- RIGHT: x=50,200,350,500 w=130 gap=20 → fits (4×130 + 3×20 = 580 ≤ 590 safe width; right edge at 630 ≤ 640)
Work bottom-up for trees: size leaf tier first, parent width ≥ sum of children.

**Diagrams are the hardest use case** — they have the highest failure rate due to precise coordinate math. Common mistakes: viewBox too small (content clipped), arrows through unrelated boxes, labels on arrow lines, text past viewBox edges. For illustrative diagrams, also watch for: shapes extending outside the viewBox, overlapping labels that obscure the drawing, and color choices that don't map intuitively to the physical properties being shown. Double-check coordinates before finalizing.

Use SVG for diagrams. The widget automatically wraps SVG output in a card.

**Pick the right diagram type.** The decision is about *intent*, not subject matter. Ask: is the user trying to *document* this, or *understand* it?

**Reference diagrams** — the user wants a map they can point at. Precision matters more than feeling. Boxes, labels, arrows, containment. These are the diagrams you'd find in documentation.
- **Flowchart** — steps in sequence, decisions branching, data transforming. Good for: approval workflows, request lifecycles, build pipelines, "what happens when I click submit". Trigger phrases: *"walk me through the process"*, *"what are the steps"*, *"what's the flow"*.
- **Structural diagram** — things inside other things. Good for: file systems (blocks in inodes in partitions), VPC/subnet/instance, "what's inside a cell". Trigger phrases: *"what's the architecture"*, *"how is this organised"*, *"where does X live"*.

**Intuition diagrams** — the user wants to *feel* how something works. The goal isn't a correct map, it's the right mental model. These should look nothing like a flowchart. The subject doesn't need a physical form — it needs a *visual metaphor*.
- **Illustrative diagram** — draw the mechanism. Physical things get cross-sections (water heaters, engines, lungs). Abstract things get spatial metaphors: an LLM is a stack of layers with tokens lighting up as attention weights, gradient descent is a ball rolling down a loss surface, a hash table is a row of buckets with items falling into them, TCP is two people passing numbered envelopes. Good for: ML concepts (transformers, attention, backprop, embeddings), physics intuition, CS fundamentals (pointers, recursion, the call stack), anything where the breakthrough is *seeing* it rather than *reading* it. Trigger phrases: *"how does X actually work"*, *"explain X"*, *"I don't get X"*, *"give me an intuition for X"*.

**Route on the verb, not the noun.** Same subject, different diagram depending on what was asked:

| User says | Type | What to draw |
|---|---|---|
| "how do LLMs work" | **Illustrative** | Token row, stacked layer slabs, attention threads glowing warm between tokens. Go interactive if you can. |
| "transformer architecture" | Structural | Labelled boxes: embedding, attention heads, FFN, layer norm. |
| "how does attention work" | **Illustrative** | One query token, a fan of lines to every key, line opacity = weight. |
| "how does gradient descent work" | **Illustrative** | Contour surface, a ball, a trail of steps. Slider for learning rate. |
| "what are the training steps" | Flowchart | Forward → loss → backward → update. Boxes and arrows. |
| "how does TCP work" | **Illustrative** | Two endpoints, numbered packets in flight, an ACK returning. |
| "TCP handshake sequence" | Flowchart | SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK. Three boxes. |
| "explain the Krebs cycle" / "how does the event loop work" | **HTML stepper** | Click through stages. Never a ring. |
| "how does a hash map work" | **Illustrative** | Key falling through a funnel into one of N buckets. |
| "draw the database schema" / "show me the ERD" | **mermaid.js** | `erDiagram` syntax. Not SVG. |

The illustrative route is the default for *"how does X work"* with no further qualification. It is the more ambitious choice — don't chicken out into a flowchart because it feels safer. Claude draws these well.

Don't mix families in one diagram. If you need both, draw the intuition version first (build the mental model), then the reference version (fill in the precise labels) as a second tool call with prose between.

**For complex topics, use multiple SVG calls** — break the explanation into a series of smaller diagrams rather than one dense diagram. Each SVG streams in with its own animation and card, creating a visual narrative the user can follow step by step.

**Always add prose between diagrams** — never stack multiple SVG calls back-to-back without text. Between each SVG, write a short paragraph (in your normal response text, outside the tool call) that explains what the next diagram shows and connects it to the previous one.

**Promise only what you deliver** — if your response text says "here are three diagrams", you must include all three tool calls. Never promise a follow-up diagram and omit it. If you can only fit one diagram, adjust your text to match. One complete diagram is better than three promised and one delivered.

#### Flowchart

For sequential processes, cause-and-effect, decision trees.

**Planning**: Size boxes to fit their text generously. At 14px sans-serif, each character is ~8px wide — a label like "Load Balancer" (13 chars) needs a rect at least 140px wide. When in doubt, make boxes wider and leave more space between them. Cramped diagrams are the most common failure mode.

**Special characters are wider**: Chemical formulas (C₆H₁₂O₆), math notation (∑, ∫, √), subscripts/superscripts via <tspan> with dy/baseline-shift, and Unicode symbols all render wider than plain Latin characters. For labels containing formulas or special notation, add 30-50% extra width to your estimate. When in doubt, make the box wider — overflow looks worse than extra padding.

**Spacing**: 60px minimum between boxes, 24px padding inside boxes, 12px between text and edges. Leave 10px gap between arrowheads and box edges. Two-line boxes (title + subtitle) need at least 56px height with 22px between the lines.

**Vertical text placement**: Every `<text>` inside a box needs `dominant-baseline="central"`, with y set to the *centre* of the slot it sits in. Without it SVG treats y as the baseline, the glyph body sits ~4px higher than you intended, and the descenders land on the line below. Formula: for text centred in a rect at (x, y, w, h), use `<text x={x+w/2} y={y+h/2} text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">`. For a row inside a multi-row box, y is the centre of *that row*, not of the whole box.

**Layout**: Prefer single-direction flows (all top-down or all left-right). Keep diagrams simple — max 4-5 nodes per diagram. The widget is narrow (~680px) so complex layouts break.

**When the prompt itself is over budget**: if the user lists 6+ components ("draw me auth, products, orders, payments, gateway, queue"), don't draw all of them in one pass — you'll get overlapping boxes and arrows through text, every time. Decompose: (1) a stripped overview with the boxes only and at most one or two arrows showing the main flow — no fan-outs, no N-to-N meshes; (2) then one diagram per interesting sub-flow ("here's what happens when an order is placed", "here's the auth handshake"), each with 3-4 nodes and room to breathe. Count the nouns before you draw. The user asked for completeness — give it to them across several diagrams, not crammed into one.

**Cycles don't get drawn as rings.** If the last stage feeds back into the first (Krebs cycle, event loop, GC mark-and-sweep, TCP retransmit), your instinct is to place the stages around a circle. Don't. Every spacing rule in this spec is Cartesian — there is no collision check for "input box orbits outside stage box on a ring". You will get satellite boxes overlapping the stages they feed, labels sitting on the dashed circle, and tangential arrows that point nowhere. The ring is decoration; the loop is conveyed by the return arrow.

Build a stepper in HTML. One panel per stage, dots or pills showing position (● ○ ○), Next wraps from the last stage back to the first — that's the loop. Each panel owns its inputs and products: an event loop's pending callbacks live *inside* the Poll panel, not floating next to a box on a ring. Nothing collides because nothing shares the canvas. Only fall back to a linear SVG (stages in a row, curved `<path>` return arrow) when there's one input and one output total and no per-stage detail to show.

**Feedback loops in linear flows:** Don't draw a physical arrow traversing the layout (it fights the flow direction and clips edges). Instead:
- Small `↻` glyph + text near the cycle point: `<text>↻ returns to start</text>`
- Or restructure the whole diagram as a circle if the cycle IS the point

**Arrows:** A line from A to B must not cross any other box or label. If the direct path crosses something, route around with an L-bend: `<path d="M x1 y1 L x1 ymid L x2 ymid L x2 y2"/>`. Place arrow labels in clear space, not on the midpoint.

Keep all nodes the same height when they have the same content type (e.g. all single-line boxes = 44px, all two-line boxes = 56px).

**Flowchart components** — use these patterns consistently:

*Single-line node* (44px tall): title only. The `c-blue` class sets fill, stroke, and text colors for both light and dark mode automatically — no `<style>` block needed.
```svg
<g class="node c-blue" onclick="sendPrompt('Tell me more about T-cells')">
  <rect x="100" y="20" width="180" height="44" rx="8" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="190" y="42" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">T-cells</text>
</g>
```

*Two-line node* (56px tall): bold title + muted subtitle.
```svg
<g class="node c-blue" onclick="sendPrompt('Tell me more about dendritic cells')">
  <rect x="100" y="20" width="200" height="56" rx="8" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="200" y="38" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">Dendritic cells</text>
  <text class="ts" x="200" y="56" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">Detect foreign antigens</text>
</g>
```

*Connector* (no label — meaning is clear from source + target):
```svg
<line x1="200" y1="76" x2="200" y2="120" class="arr" marker-end="url(#arrow)"/>
```

*Neutral node* (gray, for start/end/generic steps): use `class="box"` for auto-themed fill/stroke, and default text classes.

Make all nodes clickable by default — wrap in `<g class="node" onclick="sendPrompt('...')">`. The hover effect is built in.
